      <p>Countrysize is a personal attempt to make it easier to understand events - natural disasters, wars, politics - which take place on a scale which is hard to understand.  The idea is that you can compare the area of interest to an area you are more familiar with.  It can only be a rough approximation of the true scale.
      <p>I have to credit the CIA for most of the data and maps used on this site.  The <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html">global factbook</a> is a comprehensive resource which I believe they are required to make available to the public because of US laws.  I'm sure this obligation doesn't extend to non Americans like me, so I hope they don't mind.
